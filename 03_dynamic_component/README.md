# Create Dynamic and Reusable Components

## What are Dynamic Components?
1. Dynamic Content: JSX allows the creation of dynamic and interactive Ul components.
2. JavaScript Expressions: Using `{}`, we can embed any JS expression directly within JSX. This includes variables, function calls, and more.

## Reusable Components
1. **Modularity:** Components are modular, allowing for easy reuse across different parts of an application.
2. **Consistency:** Reusing components ensures Ul consistency and reduces the chance of discrepancies.
3. **Efficiency:** Reduces development time and effort by avoiding duplication of code.
4. **Maintainability:** Changes made to a reused component reflect everywhere it's used, simplifying updates and bug fixes.
